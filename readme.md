# My Blog API
This is a 3 part project for my personal blog. I started with an API to build up the back end of storing
and retrieving the data, then created seperate repos for the user interface, as well as an interface for the
actual blogger (me!). User interface allows users to view my content, as well as post comments on said contnent, no log in required.
The author portion allows me to view published and non-published posts, delete posts, edit posts, and delete user comments on posts.
This was a great project to continue hammering in good CRUD fundamentals as well as practicing Node.js, express and
MongoDB some more. Really fun creating my own API to pull data from instead of pulling it from someone else.
